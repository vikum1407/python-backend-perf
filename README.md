# Backend Performance QE Hands on Assessment

Prerequisites:
* Install python and pip
* Install docker
```bash
    pip install docker
```

## Question Approach:
    I approached the problem by breaking it down into main tasks, as outlined below. Then I developed these tasks as methods and verified the container's response status code (200) to confirm its functionality.

## Main Features:

      1. Docker pull
      2. Docker run
      3. Docker container verification
      4. Delete docker container
